Frontend Mentor | Product preview card component challenge solution
what i learned: mixing bootstrap grids with my own divs,
letter-spacing: and  text-decoration-line: line-through; were new properties to me

good review for:
fitting background image into a resized div :
background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: 100%;
    padding-top: 66.64%; 
    border-radius: 2% 0% 0% 2%;
    
and utilizing relative positioning for parent element, before using absolute for positioning for children elements.
